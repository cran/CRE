\description{
Provides an interpretable identification of subgroups with
heterogeneous causal effect. The heterogeneous subgroups are
discovered through ensemble learning of causal rules. Causal rules are
highly interpretable if-then statement that recursively partition the
features space into heterogeneous subgroups. A small number of
significant causal rules are selected through Stability Selection to
control for family-wise error rate in the finite sample setting. It
proposes various estimation methods for the conditional causal effects
for each discovered causal rule.  It is highly flexible and multiple
causal estimands and imputation methods are implemented.
